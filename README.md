# Park Runners

Park Runners is a set of tools that aim to simplify organization of local running events. It's heavily inspired by ParkRun http://www.parkrun.com/ from where the most of the ideas are coming from.

The reason for this suite is that ParkRun is limited to only a small number of countries while these tools enable anyone to create a running event in their community.
